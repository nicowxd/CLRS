### Exercise 1.2-1
***
Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms 
involved.

### `Answer`

### Exercise 1.2-2
***
Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size *n*, insertion sort runs 
in ![](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%208n%5E%7B2%7D%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=mathpple&edit=0) steps, while merge 
sort runs in __64*n* lg*n*__ steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?

### `Answer`

### Exercise 1.2-3
***
What is the smallest value of *n* such that an algorithm whose running time is 
![](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=100n%5E%7B2%7D%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=mathpple&edit=0) runs faster than an 
algorithm whose running time is 
![](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=2%5E%7Bn%7D%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=mathpple&edit=0) on the same machine?
