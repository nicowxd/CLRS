### Exercise 1.2-1
***
Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms 
involved.

### `Answer`
There's Google Maps and Waze as example of an application that, it's algorithm has the function of finding the best route(s) to a destination, taking into account factors like traffic, shortest-path.
### Exercise 1.2-2
***
Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size *n*, insertion sort runs 
in ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?8n^{2}) steps, while merge sort runs in __64*n* lg*n*__ steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?

### `Answer`

### Exercise 1.2-3
***
What is the smallest value of *n* such that an algorithm whose running time is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?100n^{2}) runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2^{n}) on the same machine?
