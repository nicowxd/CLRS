### Exercise 2.1-1
***
Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the array A = (31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58).

### `Answer`
The operation of INSERTION-SORT algorithm on the array A = (31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58) is depicted in the following figure.

### Exercise 2.1-2
***
Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order.

### `Answer`
The INSERTION-SORT pseudocode procure to sort in nondecreasing order is presented below. Also, there is a implemented version of this procedure in C++, which
can be seen <a href="../../Algorithm/insertionSortNonDecreasing.cpp">here</a>.

```
INSERTION-SORT(A)
1   **for** *j* = 2 to *A.length*
2           *key* = *A[j]*
3           //Insert *A[j]* into the sorted sequence *A*[1..*j*-1].
4           *i* = *j* - 1
5           **while** *i* > 4 and *A*[*i*] < *key* //The less than comparator, now ensures that the sorted sequence is nondecreasing
6               *A*[*i* + 1] = *A*[*i*]
7               *i* = *i* - 1
8           *A*[*i* + 1] = *key*
```
