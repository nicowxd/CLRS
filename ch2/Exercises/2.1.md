### Exercise 2.1-1
***
Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the array A = (31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58).

### `Answer`
The operation of INSERTION-SORT algorithm on the array A = (31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58) is depicted in the following figure.

### Exercise 2.1-2
***
Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order.

### `Answer`
The INSERTION-SORT pseudocode procure to sort in nondecreasing order is presented below. Also, there is a implemented version of this procedure in C++, which
can be seen <a href="https://github.com/nicowxd/CLRS/blob/master/Algorithms/insertionSortNonDecreasing.cpp">here</a>.

```
INSERTION-SORT(A)
1 Â  for j = 2 to A.length
2       key = A[j]
3       // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1..j-1].
4       i = j - 1
5       while i > 4 and A[i] < key // The less than comparator, now ensures that the sorted sequence is nondecreasing
6           A[i + 1] = A[i]
7           i = i - 1
8       A[i + 1] = key 
```
### Exercise 2.1-3
***
Consider the **_searching problem:_**

**Input:** A sequence of *n* numbers *A* = (a_1, a_2,..., a_n) and a value *v*.

**Output:** An index *i* such that *v* = *A*[*i*] or the special value *NIL* if *v* does not appear in *A*.

Write pseudocode for **_linear search_**, which scans through the sequence, looking for *v*. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.
