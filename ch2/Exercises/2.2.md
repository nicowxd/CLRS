### `Answer`
Θ(![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n^3))

### Exercise 2.2-2
***
Consider sorting *n* numbers stored in array *A* by first finding the smallest element of *A* and exchanging it with the element in *A*[1]. Then find the second smallest element of *A*, and exchange it with *A*[2]. Continue in this manner for the first *n* - 1 elements of *A*. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as **selection sort**. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first *n* - 1 elements, rather than for all *n* elements? Give the best-case  and worst-case running times of selection sort in Θ-notation.

### `Answer`

The pseudocode is depicted below. There is also a C++ implemented version of the selection sort algorithm <a href="https://github.com/nicowxd/CLRS/blob/master/Algorithms/selectionSort.cpp">here</a>

The loop invariant is:
    
    At each iteration of the outer loop, we maintain the subarray A[1..j-1] with the first j-1 smallest elements, which ensures that the subarray A[1..j-1] is always sorted in increasing order.

Since it is guaranteed by the loop invariant that at the last for check, the first *n* - 1 elements are the smallest, this ensures that the last one remaining is indeed the largest. Therefore we don't need to scan the whole array, because the *n*-th element is in the right position.

The best case and the worst-case running times of the selection sort are Θ(![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n^2)). Although the proof is not yet shown, a good way to see that no matter what case it is, it will be Θ(![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n^2)), is that in either way, both the best-case and the worst-case running time, we always iterate on the inner loop. Since there is an outer loop iterating through 1 to *n* - 1 and an inner loop, iterating through *j* + 1 to *n*, it is easy to see that both the running times are of ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n^2) order.

### Exercise 2.2-4
***
How can we modify almost any algorithm to have a good best-case running time?

### `Answer`
To improve the best-case running time of almost any algorithm, one can just test a condition on the given input before any work is done. Since we are dealing with the best-case, it should always evaluate true to this condition and therefore the running time is improved.
