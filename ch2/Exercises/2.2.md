### `Answer`
Θ(![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n^3))

### Exercise 2.2-2
***
Consider sorting *n* numbers stored in array *A* by first finding the smallest element of *A* and exchanging it with the element in *A*[1]. Then find the second smallest element of *A*, and exchange it with *A*[2]. Continue in this manner for the first *n* - 1 elements of *A*. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as **selection sort**. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first *n* - 1 elements, rather than for all *n* elements? Give the best-case  and worst-case running times of selection sort in Θ-notation.
